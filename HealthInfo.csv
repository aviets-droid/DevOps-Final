Enigma,Enigma Syndrome (ES),"Catch-all term for neurological issues associated with the Enigma morph. Efforts to 'breed out' Enigma Syndrome have all failed, therefore there is no such thing as an 'ES free' Enigma. Enigma Syndrome varies in severity, but may include the following symptoms: difficulty with walking and hunting, seizures, head tilting, death rolling, balance problems, and heightened sensitivity to stressors."
NDBE (Noir Desir Black Eye),"Infertility, Eye Deformities","NDBE geckos all frequently have deformed faces, specifically the eyes, which may be small and malformed. Visual NDBE females are all infertile."
Diablo Blanco,Aggression,"Diablo Blanco leopard geckos are associated with aggression issues. While this doesn't necessarily affect the gecko negatively, it is important to note for keepers, who may want to more frequently leave their Diablo Blancos alone and take more care with feedings."
Super Giant,Increased General Susceptibility,"Super Giants are more susceptible to general health issues that may affect leopard geckos, such as MBDE, so greater care should be taken to assure the geckos needs are met."
Lemon Frost,Malignant Iridophore Cell Tumors,"Lemon Frosts develop tumors as they age, caused by the same gene that gives them their color, therefore it is impossible to separate this health issue from the morph. This health problem results in a shortened lifespan and reduced quality of life, Lemon Frosts typically do not live more than 1-2 years. It is considered unethical to create more Lemon Frosts by many breeders."
